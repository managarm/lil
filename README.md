> **TL;DR: don't expect this to work yet, API are absolutely not stable yet**

Currently, `lil` is in active development. It might or might not work on your hardware, and hardware `lil` supports might not operate correctly in all cases. All APIs, public-facing or not, are not yet stable.Â They can and will change without notice, at least until we start tagging releases.
